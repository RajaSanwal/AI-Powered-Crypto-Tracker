1. First, i used a BOLT.ai to create the structure and code of whole project. But there are some issues. So, i used chatgpt to overcome these issues.

2. Vanry is overlapping with the price of coin. So i passed below prompt to chatgpt
Prompt: "Currently Vanry/USDT overlapping with coin card. Update vanry/usdt section so it wouldnot overlap with coin prive.
This is my current code.‚Äù (I pasted my CoinCard component for modification to support Vanry/USDT)

3. Dark and Light Theme Toggle not working. 
Prompt: " Theme switching button is not working properly. Update it so that dark and light theme can be switched.
my current code is (I provided useTheme.ts and ThemeToggle.tsx file)"

4. Sometime multiple hits to free CoinGreko api failed. Ask gpt to update it. It only added 3 retries logic inside service/cryptoService.ts.
